# Eye-tracking Test with Competitor Sites

* Test purpose: understand how users navigate through these sites with a task to purchase a door.
* We accumulated 17 sites and online platforms that specialized in furniture, architecture and building materials. Some are references from the client, and some are discovered by our team. We compared the similarities and specialties, and selected 6 representative sites to test. 3 are main sites to test, the other 3 are backups.
* In the end, 15 eye-tracking tests were conducted with these 3 sites:
    * https://www.byggfabriken.se/
    * https://professionals.muuto.com/
    * https://www.blocket.se/

## Eye-tracking Test with Competitor Sites

* Insights from the tests
    * Horizontal scrolling is intuitive and frequently used by the users. 
    * Itâ€™s crucial to maintain a balance between providing sufficient information and avoiding information overload to ensure a positive user experience.
    * Issues with readability were noted, including small text and lack of contrast, making it hard for users to read certain sections of the website.
    * The clarity of general information, categorization and prioritization should have higher priority than visual appeal for smooth navigation.
    * Users value transparency and prefer to see the rating of the seller or have a communication channel with the seller before making a purchase.
    * While some users prefer to navigate through categories, others opt for direct searches using the search bar. Providing both options ensures that users can choose the method that suits them best.
    * Users purchasing vintage items appreciate transparency regarding the product's condition, location, and weight, particularly for delivery purposes. Providing relevant information and possibly incorporating user reviews can enhance trust in the product's quality.
