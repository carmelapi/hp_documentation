# System Requirements

<FileTree>
To ensure a smooth development and operation of the project, developers need to meet the following hardware and software prerequisites:

- **Node.js:** Version 14.x or newer. This is essential for supporting the latest JavaScript features and efficient package management with npm.
- **NPM:** Version 6.x or newer, which typically comes bundled with Node.js installations. This is used for managing project dependencies.
- **Git:** Version 2.x or higher for source control management, enabling collaboration and version tracking.
- **Text Editor or IDE:** We recommend Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text for their extensive support for JavaScript and React development.

These requirements are designed to provide a baseline that can support the advanced features and functionalities of our project, ensuring developers can work effectively without performance bottlenecks.
</FileTree>

Before to start, the following requirements must be installed on your computer:

<Steps>

### Node.js
Only Active LTS or Maintenance LTS versions are supported (currently v18 and v20). Odd-number releases of Node, known as "current" versions of Node.js, are not supported (e.g. v19, v21).
Your preferred Node.js package manager:
npm (v6 and above)
yarn

#### Npm
 To manage JavaScript packages, installing npm (Node Package Manager) is essential as it facilitates the installation, updating, and removal of packages in Node.js environments. It provides access to a vast registry of open-source libraries, simplifying the development process. Additionally, npm enhances project dependency management, ensuring consistent and reliable builds.
```bash
npm install
```
#### Git
Used for version control management, it enables collaboration and version tracking. Ensure you have Git version 2.x or higher installed.
For the terminal command to check the installation and version of Git, you can include:
```tsx
git --version
```
This command checks the current version of [Git website](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your machine. If readers need to install or update Git, you can direct them to visit the official Git website for detailed installation instructions.
#### Visual Studio Code
We have used VSCode as code editor for the project, but feel free to use any text editor of your choice.

## Installing React and Libraries
This section of the documentation guides you through the installation of React and the necessary libraries for the project. Ensure that you meet the system prerequisites before proceeding with the installation.  
To install React along with all the required dependencies for the project, follow these steps:

<Steps>

### Clone the repository: 
Clone the project repository to your local system using:
```tsx
git clone git@github.com:fedux-collab-team-6/historical-parts.git
cd historical-parts
```
### Development Dependencies
The following are development dependencies used to optimize and test the project:
**Vite and @vitejs/plugin-react:** Modern tools for optimizing the development process and fast module bundling.
```bash
npm create vite@latest
```
**ESLint and Prettier** Tools to keep your code clean and consistent.
**Jest** Framework for unit testing in JavaScript.
```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```


### Install dependencies
**React and React-DOM:** Libraries for building the user interface of the project.
```tsx
npm install react react-dom
```
**@mui/icons-material:** Material-UI component libraries for React to build 
```bash
npm install @mui/icons-material

// If you are not already using Material UI in your project, you can add it with:
npm install @mui/material
```
**Redux and React-Redux:** Manages navigation in React applications
```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
```
**Axios:** Library for making HTTP requests from the browser.
```bash
npm install axios
