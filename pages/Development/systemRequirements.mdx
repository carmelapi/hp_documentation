# System Requirements

To ensure a smooth development and operation of the project, developers need to meet the following hardware and software prerequisites:
- **Node.js:** Version 14.x or newer. This is essential for supporting the latest JavaScript features and efficient package management with npm.
- **NPM:** Version 6.x or newer, which typically comes bundled with Node.js installations. This is used for managing project dependencies.
- **Git:** Version 2.x or higher for source control management, enabling collaboration and version tracking.
- **Text Editor or IDE:** We recommend Visual Studio Code, Atom, or Sublime Text for their extensive support for JavaScript and React development.

These requirements are designed to provide a baseline that can support the advanced features and functionalities of our project, ensuring developers can work effectively without performance bottlenecks.
