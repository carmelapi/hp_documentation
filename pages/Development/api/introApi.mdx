# API Documentation

This documentation covers the essential aspects of our APIs, which are powered by Strapi, the headless CMS. Our API setup allows developers to use their preferred tools and frameworks, providing a flexible way for editors to manage and distribute content.


## Introduction

We have implemented Strapi as our CMS to enhance content management and distribution. Strapi's flexible plugin system allows us to customize every aspect of the CMS to fit our specific use cases, including a built-in user system to manage detailed access for administrators and end-users.

## Authentication

Currently, our project setup does not include direct examples of handling authentication in the provided code snippets. Authentication typically involves obtaining a JWT token from Strapi by sending a POST request to the `/auth/local` endpoint, which is not directly shown in the initial setup.

## API Endpoints

Here, we describe the API endpoints we have set up in Strapi, including how to interact with them to manage products, categories, and user data.


#### Products Endpoint

- **List Products**
  Retrieve all products, utilizing Strapi's powerful query capabilities for filtering and pagination.

  ```http
  GET /products?pagination[page]=${currentPage}&pagination[pageSize]=${itemsPerPage}&

### Products

We utilize Strapi to handle our product listings. The endpoints allow for listing all products with options for filtering and pagination, as well as fetching detailed information on individual products.
