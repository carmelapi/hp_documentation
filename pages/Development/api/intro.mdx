# INTRO
We have integrated Strapi into our project.  
This is a popular open-source content management system (CMS) that allows us to rapidly create APIs through a user-friendly interface. It is based on Node.js and offers extensive flexibility as it can be customized to fit any SQL or NoSQL database.

### What we wse Strapi for

**1. Rapid and Flexible API Development:** Strapi enables us to quickly build REST or GraphQL APIs. We can easily create custom endpoints, configure data relationships, and manage content types with ease.

**2. Headless CMS:** As a headless CMS, Strapi focuses solely on content management and delivery via APIs, making it ideal for integration with any front end, from static websites to mobile apps or IoT services.

**3. Content Management:** Strapi provides a robust admin panel that allows our non-technical team members to easily manage content. This includes functionalities such as creating, updating, and deleting content, as well as managing users and customizing permissions.

**4. Plugins and Customization:** Strapi supports a wide range of plugins that extend its functionality, such as authentication, email, and file management. We also have the capability to write our own plugins to meet specific needs.

**5. Community and Support:** Being open source, Strapi has an active community of developers and users who constantly contribute new features, bug fixes, and support through forums and group chats.

We appreciate Strapi for its extensibility and scalability, making it a popular choice among developers looking for a modern CMS solution that can evolve as the needs of our project grow.
