## Tailwind Css
Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.  
It's fast, flexible, and reliable — with zero-runtime.

- Install `tailwindcss` via npm, and create your `tailwind.config.js` file.
```bash
> npm install -D tailwindcss  
> npx tailwindcss init
```

- Add the paths to all of your template files in your `tailwind.config.js` file.
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

- Add the `@tailwind` directives for each of Tailwind’s layers to your main CSS file.
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

- Run the CLI tool to scan your template files for classes and build your CSS.
```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
```
