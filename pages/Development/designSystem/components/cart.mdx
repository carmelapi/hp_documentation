# Cart
In our project, the Cart component plays a crucial role in the e-commerce functionality. It handles the display and management of products that users add to their shopping cart. This component integrates with Redux for state management, ensuring that cart data is centrally managed and accessible throughout the application.  
The Cart component is designed to be a self-contained module for managing a shopping cart's UI and functionality. It is crucial for the shopping experience on e-commerce platforms, providing users with immediate feedback about their current selections and total expenditures.

## Structure
- **DeleteOutlinedIcon** from `"@mui/icons-material/DeleteOutlined"`: This icon is used as a delete button within the cart for removing items.
- **useDispatch**, **useSelector** from `"react-redux"`: These hooks allow the component to interact with the Redux store. useDispatch is used to dispatch actions to the store, whereas useSelector is used to retrieve state from the store.
- **removeItem**, **resetCart** from `"../../../redux/cartReducer"`: Actions imported from the cart reducer that handle removing a single item and resetting the entire cart.
- **Link** from `"react-router-dom"` and Button from `"./Button"`: Link is used for navigation, and Button is a custom component for user interactions within the cart.

## Props
This component does not accept any props but relies on the Redux store for its state:
- **State Management:** Utilizes `useSelector` to fetch the current state of the cart from the Redux store.
- **Actions:** Uses `useDispatch` to dispatch cart-related actions like removing items or resetting the cart.

## Styling and Functionality
The cart is styled to appear as a floating panel on the right side of the page, with a shadow for depth and rounded corners for a softer look. Styling is managed using Tailwind CSS classes.  

`totalPrice ` Function: Computes the total price of all items in the cart. It iterates over the products array, accumulates the total price, and formats it as a fixed decimal.

## Rendering Logic
The component conditionally renders based on the contents of the cart:

- **Empty Cart:** Displays a message indicating that the cart is empty.
- **Cart with Items:** For each product in the cart, it displays an image, description, and price. Each item also includes a delete icon to remove the item from the cart.
- **Checkout and Reset:** Provides a button to proceed to checkout and a link to reset the cart.

```javascript
import DeleteOutlinedIcon from "@mui/icons-material/DeleteOutlined";
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { removeItem, resetCart } from "../../../redux/cartReducer";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import Button from "./Button";

const Cart = () => {
  const products = useSelector((state) => state.cart.products);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const totalPrice = () => {
    let total = 0;
    products.forEach((item) => {
      total += item.price;
    });
    return total.toFixed(2);
  };

  return (
    <div className="cart absolute right-5 top-20 z-40 bg-light-200 border-[1px] border-coral-400 p-5 shadow-xl rounded-md">
      <h3 className=" text-lg font-bold mb-3">Products in your cart</h3>
      {products.length === 0 ? (
        <p className=" text-center py-9">(Cart is empty)</p>
      ) : (
        <>
          {products.map((item) => (
